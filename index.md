## Latest news

Please fill out our [onboarding survey](https://forms.gle/TN29uVsUoHYQZ7849): takes 2min max and greatly helps all SICSS organizers :upside_down_face:

## Pre-event preparation
As in past years, we recommend some pre-event preparation (reading, coding exercises). These preparations are not meant to be burdensome. We have found that they lead to a richer event. We are happy to help you with your preparations (see office hours below).

Recommended readings (this list will be updated over time):
- [Python for Economists](http://egallic.fr/Enseignement/Python/en/opening-remarks.html), by Ewen Gallic
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, by Aurelien Geron

## High-level schedule

The days will be organized around topics, with one broad topic per day:
- Day 1: Introduction to statistical learning
- Day 2: Scraping and APIs
- Day 3: Classification and regression
- Day 4: Text as data
- Day 5: Images as data

Time-wise, we will go about the days as follows:
- 09:30-12:00: Teaching input
- 12:00-13:00: Individual lunch breaks
- 13:00-16:00: Independent work in groups
- 16:00-17:30: Wrap up; depending on the day it might start only at 16:30 (but it won't last longer than 17:30)

**Important: on Monday, we will start at 09:30 instead of 10:00.**

**This is the [Zoom link](https://unisg.zoom.us/j/87496756939?pwd=OUdtakNnVzV6QWtFMWIrUHZlMVJLQT09) for our meetings.**

Along the way, there will be some input by guest speakers and lectures from the main venue in Princeton.

You can find all the videos from Princeton [here](https://sicss.io/curriculum).
Note that there are some differences between sites. Hence, it is up to you if you want to watch videos that repeat our material or if you prefer those with different content. In any case, we encourage you to check out as many Princeton videos as possible to profit from the entire SICSS universe :stars:

## SICSS festival

Usually (pre-COVID), the SICSS consists of a series of locally hosted in-person events around the world that are connected to each other by online lectures. To make SICSS as worthwile as possible, even in the absence of locally hosted events, the parent location in Princeton coordinates a SICSS festival. It is an online festival with different events around computational social science. The program is continuously updated here: https://sicss.io/festival.

## Participants

### Ajagbe, Samson
Samson is a research associate in a project on West African English on the Move at the English Department of the University of Freiburg, and an Adjunct lecturer at the Catholic University of Applied Sciences, Freiburg, where he teaches social and educational work with refugees. Samson’s work on migration and language study inspired his current research on the relationship between language and forms of discrimination. His research concentration straddles his current interest in studying language and discrimination and his previous research on democratization study. Samson received a PhD in Sociology at the University of Freiburg, and he is keen on applying natural language processing in the study of language and discrimination.

### Levy, Samuel

I am a PhD candidate in the Environmental Policy Lab at ETH Zürich with an interdisciplinary background, having previously studied social anthropology, geography and environmental science. My research investigates the relationship between land use, livelihoods and global supply chains, with a specific focus on the effectiveness and equity of zero deforestation initiatives in the cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon. To understand these issues, I primarily use econometric and network analysis approaches to analyse data that is either remotely sensed or collected from the field. However, I am increasingly drawn towards data science techniques, such as web scraping and machine learning and am excited to learn more through the SICSS!
